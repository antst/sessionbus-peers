## Current Go candidate, 2026-09-09

Current installation and policies are described in `codex/README.md` and
`docs/designs/codex-0.5.0/{LANE-SELECTION,INTERACTIVE-SELECTION}.md`. The older
facts below retain their original version and topology. In particular, the old
shared-daemon restriction on per-launch groups and the old archive-on-close
behavior are historical integration choices, not current Codex limitations.

- Native CLI override keys split literally on dots; embedded quotes around the
  plugin ID prevent activation. The working per-launch key is
  `plugins.codex@sessionbus-peers.enabled=true`. Native `config/value/write`
  has a different quote-aware key parser. The original failed no-input Open and
  corrected successful Open are preserved in `dev1-lane-open-{ebd5c0a,aaea430}`
  under `/home/antst/codex-architecture-20260909/`.
- On installed aaea430/native0.153.4, idle `thread/inject_items` staging received
  `queued_for_next_turn`; the marker appeared in native user history before any
  assistant response and was consumed in the following explicit run. The
  receipt is admission, not consumption. Evidence: `dev1-lane-stage-aaea430`.
- An omitted approval policy yielded native MCP rejection. Explicit `never`
  still rejected a tool requiring approval. Caller-selected per-plugin per-tool
  `approval_mode="approve"` allowed the public Sessionbus call; it grants that
  tool's actions, not only list. No default policy or read-only annotation was
  substituted. Evidence: `dev1-lane-{wake,grant}-aaea430`.
- A message with `idle_message:"run"` started a shared native run, whose
  retained result was collected, acknowledged and then closed. Successful
  Open itself submitted no model input. Normal close preserved saved native
  history. Four identified worker/native/configured-helper processes were
  absent after close in the grant row; no direct exit-status or arbitrary
  descendant-containment claim is made.

Interactive installed9b rows establish actual parent-to-lane lifecycle and
completion-pointer collection, idle/active admission, mixed groups, native
rename/fork/clear/resume and ordinary isolation. Normal quit and abrupt TUI death
removed the identified owned processes/endpoints. Broker SIGKILL instead left
stale socket files and the TUI's native reconnect UI; the bus row and native
server/helpers disappeared. Operator removal of those exact stale paths is
separate from product cleanup. Shared Claude smoke passed on the rebuilt real
installation. See `docs/designs/codex-0.5.0/ACCEPTANCE.md` and its manifest index
for exact limits, including controlled-only cancellation/lane interrupt/settings
coverage and inherited transcript attribution. Whole combined
9b833c3 archive size is 2,978,023 bytes, with one 7,135,394-byte linked executable
and 7,157,883 bytes across regular payload files. The increase relative to the
lane checkpoint includes the entire broker integration, not just the WebSocket
dependency. Build/member hashes are in `dev1-combined-entry/BUILD.json`.

- The 0.4.0 connector takes Codex identity from MCP `_meta.threadId`, never from tool arguments. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `ff81565:cmd/agent-sessions/connector.go:247`
- The 0.4.0 connector delivers to an active interactive thread with `turn/steer` and wakes an idle thread with `turn/start`. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:479`
- The 0.4.0 launcher starts `codex app-server daemon` and runs the TUI through `--remote unix://<control-socket>`. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/launcher/codex_peer.go:129`
- Informational and non-TUI subcommand invocations pass through with their original argv and environment; `resume` and `fork` are coordinated TUI selectors and receive the wrapper-owned `--remote` address. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/launcher/codex_peer.go:122`
- The Codex interactive option table records value-taking `--remote`, `--remote-auth-token-env`, `-i`/`--image`, `--local-provider`, and `--add-dir`; a wrapper must preserve their value arity when projecting its own flags. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/launcher/options.go:18`
- The 0.4.0 lane validates effective approval after `thread/start`, validates effective cwd and approval after `thread/resume`, and applies approval and sandbox through `thread/settings/update`. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:224`
- The 0.4.0 lane disables `features.code_mode_host` so headless tool calls stay in the App Server. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:713`
- The 0.4.0 App Server bridge handles `mcpServer/elicitation/request` and `item/tool/call`; it rejects other headless server requests with `-32601`. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/bridge/dynamic_tools.go:26`
- The 0.4.0 observer recognizes `thread/started`, `turn/started`, `turn/completed`, `thread/status/changed`, and `thread/name/updated`. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:904`
- The 0.4.0 resume path avoids a second `thread/resume` while its exact App Server client already owns the loaded thread. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:355`
- The 0.4.0 recovery path can unarchive a thread, restore loaded subscriptions after reconnect, and resolve a durable active turn with `thread/turns/list`. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:409`
- The 0.4.0 close path archives the exact thread and unsubscribes so its stdio MCP child is released. — verified: 0.4.0 — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:759`
- A turn started with the pre-rename unsupported-model probe name preserved in the captured frame below closes with status `failed`; its error object carries `message`, `codexErrorInfo`, `additionalDetails`, and `misalignment`. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-failed-turn-20260906T085803Z/appserver.jsonl`
- For an interactive TUI connected through `--remote`, command-line `mcp_servers.sessionbus.command` and `.args` do not override an installed same-name plugin MCP entry: Codex spawned the installed legacy connector and did not spawn the configured `codex-peer mcp`. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/peer/C1-failure-processes.txt`
- In remote mode the App Server daemon spawns MCP servers from the configuration it loaded; changing the installed `mcp_servers.sessionbus` entry requires restarting that daemon before an interactive TUI can use the replacement. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/peer/C1-installed-mcp-configs.txt`
- With the global entry set to `command = "codex-peer"`, `args = ["mcp"]`, and the App Server daemon restarted, Codex started `sessionbus` but its MCP client timed out after 30 seconds and published no peer presence. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/peer-rerun/C1-pane-final.txt`
- Before lazy peer initialization, `codex-peer mcp` with no `SESSIONBUS_*` environment consumed an MCP initialize request but wrote zero stdout bytes and ended with `context canceled` at the probe's five-second bound; it tried to connect to the native App Server before serving MCP. — verified: codex-peer 8323584 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/peer-rerun/manual-no-env`
- The App Server daemon resolves stdio MCP commands using the environment that started the daemon, which may omit the user's login binary directory; a bare `codex-peer` command then fails with `No such file or directory`, so the installed MCP entry uses the absolute installed executable path. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/peer-fixed/C1-blocking-pane.txt`
- The App Server control Unix socket accepts `GET /rpc` with a WebSocket upgrade, returns `101 Switching Protocols`, and exchanges masked client text frames with unmasked server text frames; a direct initialize reports Codex 0.153.4 without spawning a proxy subprocess. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/peer-absolute/ws-exchange.jsonl`
- Codex can assign a natural-language thread title containing spaces; `thread/read` returned `List agent sessions` after the matching tool prompt. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/peer-direct/manual-mcp-strace/hello-invalid.jsonl`
- With the expanded bus name grammar, a daemon-spawned MCP helper hellos under the verbatim sentence title `List agent sessions` and its `sessionbus` tool completes successfully. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C1-name-grammar/C1-pane.txt`
- A remote TUI's MCP child inherits the App Server daemon's installed MCP environment, not the launcher's `SESSIONBUS_GROUPS`. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C1-name-grammar/mcp-agentbus-env-redacted.txt`
- An observer in the launcher's requested `codex-cells` group could not see that child-backed peer when the installed MCP entry supplied no `SESSIONBUS_GROUPS`. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C1-name-grammar/C1-observer-list.json`
- A TUI `-c sessionbus_groups=["codex-cells"]` override is absent from both `thread/read` and `config/read` over the control socket; `thread/read` exposes `extra:null` but no settable per-thread metadata carrier. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C1-groups-probe/ws-frames-after-quit.jsonl`
- Interactive Codex peers share the group array stored in the installed `sessionbus` MCP entry; the default is `[]`, and per-launch `-g/--group` is unavailable because several TUI sessions share one daemon and one `CODEX_HOME`. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C1-groups-probe/ws-summary-after-quit.json`
- `/clear` starts a second daemon-owned MCP helper for the new thread; five seconds after the new helper connected, the old helper and old thread identity remained connected alongside it rather than the original helper receiving the new `_meta.threadId`. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C8-peer-identity/list-after-replace-plus-5s.json`
- A delivery addressed to the old pre-`/clear` title returned `injected` for the old thread ID, entered that thread's rollout with the exact Sessionbus carrier, and produced `Received C8_OLD_DELIVERY.` there. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C8-peer-identity/old-thread-rollout-match.txt`
- An archived thread is reported by `thread/read` with its rollout path directly under `archived_sessions`; its status alone remains `notLoaded`. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-failed-turn-20260906T085803Z/read-frames.jsonl`
- After both test threads were archived and their two MCP helpers exited, the interactive product's reusable `codex-code-mode-host` remained under its host-wide App Server daemon; it is product-owned and carries no Sessionbus identity. — verified: 0.153.4 — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C9-peer-resume-errors/residual-code-mode-host.txt`
- `UNVERIFIED:` Codex could provide per-thread peer groups if a future TUI makes the existing `thread.extra` field user-settable and readable by the daemon-spawned MCP helper.
- `UNVERIFIED:` An active `thread/read` response and the one-row `thread/turns/list` response used by interactive peer delivery have not yet been captured on 0.153.x.

## Wrapper differences from the 0.4.0 source

- `CONTRADICTION:` The failed peer probe assumed TUI `-c` values would override the remote daemon's MCP configuration. Codex 0.153.4 instead used the entry already loaded by that daemon; installation now removes any same-name entry, adds the exact global `sessionbus` entry through `codex mcp`, and restarts the daemon unconditionally. — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/peer/C1-installed-mcp-configs.txt`
- `CONTRADICTION:` The current peer launcher starts the App Server daemon and injects `--remote` only for interactive TUI launches; informational and native subcommand invocations pass through unchanged. The 0.4.0 launcher used the same branch split but also carried pending-launch coordination that the universal peer removes. — source: `internal/launcher/codex_peer.go:122`
- `CONTRADICTION:` The current lane passes its approval, sandbox, model, and private MCP config through thread requests; the 0.4.0 bridge also issued `thread/settings/update` after resume. — source: `internal/bridge/native_support.go:84`
- `CONTRADICTION:` The current App Server client rejects every server request with `-32601`; the 0.4.0 bridge handled Sessionbus dynamic tool calls and elicitation inside the App Server connection. The universal wrapper instead supplies tools through the private stdio MCP child. — source: `internal/bridge/dynamic_tools.go:26`
- `CONTRADICTION:` The current notification reader consumes only exact `turn/started` and `turn/completed` frames. The 0.4.0 observer also projected thread start, status, and name events for host-global coordination. — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:904`
- `CONTRADICTION:` The current wrapper owns one App Server child and exits on its death. The 0.4.0 host-global bridge reconnected, restored loaded subscriptions, and could unarchive recovery targets. — source: `internal/bridge/codex_native.go:409`
- `CONTRADICTION:` The earlier wrapper picture assigned `/clear` to `Peer.Replace`. Codex 0.153.4 instead starts a separate helper for the new thread and retains the old thread's helper and presence; the Codex peer backend therefore never replaces identity. — source: `/home/antst/agentbus-evidence/codex-cells-20260906T094434Z/C8-peer-identity/mcp-process-details.txt`
