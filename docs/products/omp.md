## OMP 18.1.17 tool approval source audit (2026-09-19)

The following facts come from native commit
`3b3a6dc9bbd85102ce19d0b1c11bf6870915f6ec`; they do not claim a new installed
acceptance run.

- `ToolDefinition.approval` accepts an approval decision. The extension loader
  stores the definition intact, and both registered-tool and approval wrappers
  proxy its properties. Thus `{tier: "exec", policy: "allow"}` reaches native
  resolution without an SDK conversion dropping it. Sources:
  `packages/coding-agent/src/extensibility/extensions/types.ts:642`,
  `extensions/loader.ts:180`, `extensions/wrapper.ts:47,166`, and
  `extensibility/tool-proxy.ts:6` under the same source tree.
- `resolveApproval` honors tool-owned `policy: "allow"` before the mode tier
  comparison, including under `always-ask`. An explicit native per-tool deny
  takes precedence. Source: `packages/coding-agent/src/tools/approval.ts:132-214`.
- OMP's ordinary CLI `--tools` and `--no-tools` set `options.toolNames`, but
  non-hidden extension tools are still included in unrestricted sessions.
  Do not infer Pi's exclusion behavior for OMP or reject these flags merely
  because their names match. Sources: `packages/coding-agent/src/main.ts:1343-1348`
  and `packages/coding-agent/src/sdk.ts:3293-3305`. The managed lane already
  reserves its tool-selection arguments.
- The installed results below verify primary peer, native Task child and lane
  communication under ordinary policy and preserve an unrelated mutating
  tool's approval. Source inspection alone does not establish those results.

### Native device transport and the first installed grant check

The first ordinary interactive check of `5beacab` on UMKA failed under
`always-ask`: the model invoked `write` on `xd://sessionbus`, and native Write
approval prevented the Sessionbus call. No list/send result or receiver marker
was observed. The denial and cleanup remain part of that check's evidence;
the lane default and explicit bypass message checks passed separately.

This route is native behavior. On the same 18.1.17 source,
`tools/write.ts:518-554` uses the mounted tool's tier and a device policy key,
but `tools/approval.ts:96-98` returns only the tier, dropping its declared
`policy: "allow"` at the outer Write gate. An inner tool grant therefore does
not establish unattended use through this device transport under always-ask.

Register Sessionbus with the native `loadMode: "essential"` so it is exposed
directly. `extensibility/extensions/types.ts:634-636` documents this choice,
`extensions/wrapper.ts:47-48` preserves it, and `tools/xdev.ts:84-87` plus
`sdk.ts:3350-3362` keep essential tools top-level. Other tools retain their
native presentation and policy. The exec-tier allow remains unchanged. The fresh installed checks below verify the correction;
the previous failed attempt is not relabeled or replayed.

The first direct-tool lane check of `817879c` exposed a separate schema issue:
native `openai-codex/gpt-5.5` supplied defaults for all optional union argument
fields. The public validator rejected those foreign fields; no message was
delivered. Preserve that failure separately from the earlier approval failure.

Declare `strict: false` on this tool. Native
`extensibility/extensions/types.ts:643-645` documents explicit false as distinct
from omission, and the wrappers forward the property. In the same source,
`packages/ai/src/providers/openai-codex-responses.ts:4744-4752` emits explicit
`strict: false` only when the definition supplies it (unless the native global
strict-field suppression is selected). `packages/ai/src/utils/schema/CONSTRAINTS.md:56`
records optional-field overfill on backends when the flag is omitted. This
tool-local setting preserves the public optional-field schema and validation;
it does not remove unexpected arguments or change any other tool. Registration
tests cover lane, primary and Task-child definitions.

## Installed communication checks (2026-09-19)

Candidate `d84c4e1c27a89b14a94882a29d054b869ca9f396` was installed through
its ordinary archive installer into UMKA's permanent installation, with native
OMP 18.1.17 and `openai-codex/gpt-5.5`. Ordinary lane, primary peer and native
Task-child calls listed their identities and sent unique markers with settled
`injected` receipts and direct receiver observation. Calls used top-level
`sessionbus` with sparse action arguments. An unrelated native write still
prompted under `always-ask`; declining it returned `Tool call denied by user:
write`, and the file was absent. Explicit bypass lane and primary `--yolo`
checks also delivered their markers. This does not claim a Task-child bypass
check on this final candidate.

The earlier Write-transport approval failure, optional-field overfill failure,
and an earlier bypass primary/Task check with no shared receiver group remain
recorded separately. No successful delivery is attributed to those failed
checks. All owned sessions and processes were cleaned up; the daemon stayed
healthy. Evidence is sealed at `omp-comms-grant-installed-20260919`:
`SHA256SUMS` SHA256
`79909c0a7661bcb06463ade2a7f6f74017edfa80eac8735f16e609577172ed93`;

## Historical product facts

### Explicit bypass compatibility and earlier working implementation

The earlier `ff81565:internal/products/omp/permission.go:15-23` mapped explicit
`bypassPermissions` to `--approval-mode=yolo`. Its shared extension registered
its then-current public tool without a tool-owned approval declaration
(`ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:100-115`). Retain the explicit bypass
behavior; do not infer that this legacy path proved a narrow default grant.

On native `3b3a6dc9bbd85102ce19d0b1c11bf6870915f6ec`,
`packages/coding-agent/src/cli/args.ts:279-280` maps `--yolo` and
`--auto-approve` to the same option. `cli/flag-tables.ts:226-234` accepts
`--approval-mode=yolo`, and `main.ts:1524-1531` applies it only to the running
session's settings. `tools/approval.ts:157-175` preserves an explicit tool-owned
allow in yolo mode. The managed extension keeps its exec-tier allow in both
ordinary and bypass launches. A lane's `permission_mode=bypassPermissions`
selects `--approval-mode=yolo`; empty/default still injects no global mode.

The UMKA help-only capture on 2026-09-19 confirms OMP 18.1.17 and
`--auto-approve` / `--approval-mode` at lines 57-58 of `omp-help.stdout` in
`umka-native-version-preflight-20260919` (evidence manifest SHA256
`708fa0f5b37f28098c8d3fa08a75ad349a280e92c7d0b80a087768d931d5da78`).
This capture is surface evidence; the installed results below are separate.

Current integration: see [Pi/OMP design](../designs/pi-omp-0.5.0/DESIGN.md) and
[acceptance status](../designs/pi-omp-0.5.0/ACCEPTANCE.md) for native 18.1.17.
The facts and `UNVERIFIED` questions below describe the older source snapshot;
they are preserved as historical inputs, not the current release checklist.

- Oh My Pi (OMP) was pinned and exercised as version `18.0.11`; its RPC child runs on Bun. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/quirks.go:12-20`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/quirks.go:71-77`]
- OMP requires equals-style launch controls: `omp --extension=<managed-plugin> --mode=rpc ...`; resume remains the separate pair `--session <id>`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/quirks.go:34-40`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/quirks.go:71-77`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/quirks.go:102-119`]
- The exact tested fresh argv is `--extension=/managed/sessionbus.mjs --mode=rpc --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash --tools read`; the exact tested resume argv is `--extension=/managed/sessionbus.mjs --mode=rpc --session omp-native --tools read`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:419-445`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:729-770`]
- OMP does not accept a caller-supplied fresh session ID in the pinned quirk row. The wrapper learns the native ID from `get_state`; fresh title is then applied by RPC `{"id":"as-<n>","type":"set_session_name","name":"<title>"}`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/quirks.go:71-77`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/lane.go:119-161`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:366-417`]
- OMP must emit a ready frame before any response. The exact compatible shape is `{"type":"ready","protocolVersion":1,"supportedProtocolVersions":[1],"maxFrameBytes":1048576}`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:225-260`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:312-327`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:419-423`]
- A response before ready, a repeated ready frame, an omitted protocol 1, or a `maxFrameBytes` other than 1048576 is incompatible/protocol failure. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:249-265`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:312-327`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:578-597`]
- Every RPC input is one newline-delimited JSON object. A state request is `{"id":"as-1","type":"get_state"}` and a successful response is `{"type":"response","id":"as-1","command":"get_state","success":true,"data":{"sessionId":"omp-native","sessionName":"live name","isStreaming":false,"isCompacting":false}}`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:163-201`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:50-99`]
- Responses must carry the exact pending ID and command. A native rejection has shape `{"type":"response","id":"as-1","command":"<command>","success":false,"error":"<native text>"}`; an unknown ID or command mismatch closes the protocol. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:329-351`]
- A run first confirms idle with `get_state`, then sends `{"id":"as-<n>","type":"prompt","message":"<text>"}`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/lane.go:182-220`]
- OMP's terminal event is `agent_end`. The exact continuing frame `{"type":"agent_end","willContinue":true,"messages":[]}` must be ignored; the exact terminating fixture is `{"type":"agent_end","messages":[{"stopReason":"stop"}]}`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/quirks.go:71-77`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:366-417`]
- Pi's `agent_settled` event does not terminate OMP. An accepted interrupt followed by `agent_end` with `{"stopReason":"aborted"}` yields an interrupted outcome. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:448-523`]
- Final text is fetched after terminal with `{"id":"as-<n>","type":"get_last_assistant_text"}` and response data `{"text":"<answer>"}`. Missing collection cannot be invented as empty success. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:146-160`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:330-363`]
- Active steer requires `get_state.isStreaming:true` and sends `{"id":"as-<n>","type":"steer","message":"<raw-priority>"}`. OMP performs its own system-notice framing, so callers pass the original content exactly once. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/lane.go:301-329`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:394-404`]
- Interrupt rechecks state and sends correlated `{"id":"as-<n>","type":"abort"}`. A failed abort write rolls the interrupted mark back. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/lane.go:331-353`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:526-575`]
- Fire-and-forget `extension_ui_request` methods are exactly `cancel`, `notify`, `setStatus`, `setWidget`, `setTitle`, and `set_editor_text`; they are ignored. The exact frame skeleton is `{"type":"extension_ui_request","id":"ui-1","method":"<method>"}`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:286-304`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:692-710`]
- Approval-bearing UI methods `select`, `confirm`, `input`, `editor`, and `open_url` require mediation and fail closed. The exact tested approval frame is `{"type":"extension_ui_request","id":"approval-1","method":"confirm","title":"allow tool?"}`. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc.go:294-303`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:673-690`]
- Default permission was not runnable unattended because RPC approval mediation was absent. Explicit bypass maps to `--approval-mode=yolo`; other shared permission values are unsupported. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/omp/permission.go:12-23`, `ff81565:internal/products/omp/permission_test.go:11-28`]
- The 0.4.0 sources demonstrate native `--model <provider/model>` forwarding but do not contain a typed `--thinking` translation. Any reasoning-effort spelling needs fresh product-help or host evidence before implementation. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:729-770`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/lane.go:90-133`]
- Lifecycle-owned argv includes mode, extension, session/resume/session-id, session directory/name, tools/exclusions, and approval/yolo flags; generic arguments must not override them. [OMP 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/quirks.go:121-133`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:776-790`]
- OMP's interactive integration is the same Pi-family in-process extension, selected by the three-line entrypoint `createPiFamilyExtension("omp")`. [OMP extension on 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:integrations/omp/agent-sessions.mjs:1-3`, `ff81565:integrations/omp/entrypoint.test.mjs:1-8`]
- Interactive identity comes from `ctx.sessionManager.getSessionId()`. On `session_start`, the extension reports the exact ID, native `getSessionName()`, and cwd; `session_info_changed` retitles it. [OMP extension on 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:43-51`, `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:133-197`]
- If a requested name exists and the product has no current title, the extension calls `setSessionName(requestedName)` before reporting. An existing product-owned title wins on reconnect. [OMP extension on 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:133-176`, `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.test.mjs:74-115`]
- Interactive inbound delivery calls `sendUserMessage(<rendered-text>)` while idle and `sendUserMessage(<rendered-text>,{"deliverAs":"steer"})` while busy. The busy shape is verified as native steer. [OMP extension on 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:157-174`, `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.test.mjs:117-131`]
- The old idle call has no `deliverAs:"nextTurn"` option and therefore does not verify a native next-turn queue. A wrapper must obtain product evidence before reporting `queued_for_next_turn` in peer mode. [OMP extension on 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:157-174`]
- Tool ingress is OMP's in-process extension API through the shared `registerTool({name:"sessionbus",...})`; exact session context and abort-before-dispatch are checked. No MCP transport was used by this integration. [OMP extension on 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:84-115`, `ff81565:integrations/omp/agent-sessions.mjs:1-3`]
- `session_shutdown` removes the exact identity; reason `quit` also stops the shared live client and clears the process-global extension runtime. [OMP extension on 18.0.11; source: `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:199-209`]
- CONTRADICTION requiring a host probe before implementation: the pinned 18.0.11 test uses separate `--session <id>` for resume, while the signed design requires equals-style `--resume=<id>`. Neither spelling may be selected from design alone. [OMP 18.0.11 versus pending installed version; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:419-445`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1608-1609`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1754`]
- UNVERIFIED before a new wrapper: installed OMP help/runtime evidence for `--cwd=`, `--thinking`, and `--exclude-tools`, and the complete fresh/resume/title/model/thinking argv. The pinned tests prove equals-style extension/mode and native model/tools only. [OMP version pending host probe; source: `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:419-445`, `ff81565:internal/products/pifamily/rpc_lane_test.go:729-790`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1608-1609`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1754`]
- UNVERIFIED before a new wrapper: the claimed interactive native `nextTurn` queue. The pinned extension uses ordinary idle `sendUserMessage` with no `deliverAs:"nextTurn"`; only active steer is source-proven. [OMP version pending host probe; source: `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:157-174`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1612`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1754`]
- UNVERIFIED before a new wrapper: native MCP transport/configuration support. The verified ingress is the shared in-process Pi-family extension; the signed design retains that extension in peer/direct or lane/local mode. [OMP version pending host probe; source: `ff81565:integrations/pi/pifamily.mjs:84-115`, `ff81565:integrations/omp/agent-sessions.mjs:1-3`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1611`]
