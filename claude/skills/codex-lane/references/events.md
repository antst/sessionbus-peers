# Codex lane event reference

Every lifecycle command writes newline-delimited JSON to stdout, one object per line, each with a
`type`. Human-readable diagnostics go to stderr and are never part of the contract. Redirect stdout
to a file and parse it; do not rely on `jq` being installed.

## Lifecycle events

| `type` | Emitted by | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `thread.started` | `run`, `start` | `session_id`, `peer_name` |
| `thread.resumed` | `resume` | `session_id`, `peer_name` |
| `turn.started` | `run`, `start`, `resume`, `wait` | `session_id`, `turn_id` |
| `lane.ready` | `start` | `contract_version`, `product`, `name`, `session_id`, `turn_id`, `cwd`, `groups`, `permission_mode`, `state`, `persistent`, `collection_debt`, `auto_archive`, `auto_archive_after_seconds`, `auto_archive_at`, `owner_session_id` |
| `item.completed` | `run`, `resume`, `wait` | `turn_id`, `item` |
| `turn.schema_retry` | `run`, `resume`, `wait` | `session_id`, `turn_id`, `attempt` |
| `turn.completed` | `run`, `resume`, `wait` | `turn_id`, `status`, `outcome`, `exit`, `accounting`, `usage`, `error` |
| `turn.interrupted` | `interrupt` | `session_id`, `turn_id` |
| `lane.status` | `status` | see below |
| `lane.list` | `list` | `contract_version`, `lanes` |
| `lane.doctor` | `doctor --json` | `contract_version`, reachability, runtime/profile paths |
| `lane.archived` | `archive` | `name`, `session_id`, `notices_dropped` or `already_archived`; repeated archive also reports `retirement_reasserted` |
| `error` | any | `message`, `timeout` |

`lane.ready` is the readiness barrier: the lane's turn has already started, its durable state
exists, and the peer is registered. There is no window in which a discoverable lane has no turn to
receive a message. Check `contract_version` here; refuse anything other than `2`.

## Reading the final answer

`item` is passed through from App Server with its `type` normalized to snake case. An agent message
carries `id`, `type`, `phase`, and `text`.

1. Take the **last** `turn.completed` in the stream; read `turn_id`, `outcome`, `exit`.
2. Select the `item.completed` where `turn_id` matches and `item.type == "agent_message"` and
   `item.phase == "final_answer"`.
3. The result is `item.text`.

A `final_answer` followed by `turn.schema_retry` is a rejected draft from a schema-constrained lane.
That retry event's `turn_id` identifies the rejected draft and `attempt` is the 1-based correction
attempt. Only the `final_answer` belonging to the terminal `turn_id` is authoritative. Anchoring on
the terminal `turn_id` handles this case without special-casing it.

## Terminal status

`status` is App Server's raw value. `outcome` is the normalized value and is the one to report.
They differ when a durable deadline fires: raw `status` is usually `interrupted` while `outcome` is
`timed_out`.

| `outcome` | `exit` |
|---|---|
| `completed` | 0 |
| `timed_out` | 124 |
| `interrupted` | 130 |
| anything else | 1 |

## `lane.status`

`name`, `session_id`, `status`, `cwd`, `turn_id`, `turn_status`, `collected_turn_id`,
`persistent`, `auto_archive`, `auto_archive_after_seconds`, `auto_archive_at`, `owner_session_id`,
`outcome`, `exit`.

`outcome` and `exit` are `null` while a turn is still running. `collected_turn_id` is the `wait`
cursor: a terminal `turn_id` that does not equal it is uncollected. An archived lane reports
`status: "archived"` and keeps its recorded `outcome`. Its transcript is resumable, but a prior
uncollected detached answer is no longer available through `wait`.

## Discovery and preflight

`lane.list` contains a `lanes` array. Each row carries `name`, `session_id`, `cwd`,
`status`, `turn_id`, `collected_turn_id`, `persistent`,
`auto_archive`, `auto_archive_after_seconds`, `auto_archive_at`, `owner_session_id`, `outcome`, and `exit`.
Active lanes are returned by default and `--all` adds archived, resumable lanes.
`--mine` filters by the current orchestrator's owner PID and process-start identity. It excludes
persistent lanes; combine it with `--all` to include owned archived lanes. It fails closed when no
live Codex or Claude owner can be corroborated.

`auto_archive_at` is a Unix-millisecond deadline or `null`. It is armed only after the latest turn
has reached its final terminal state and cleared when a newer turn starts. It is a not-before
deadline; cleanup normally occurs within five seconds afterward on the supervisor's next
reconciliation tick.
`auto_archive_after_seconds` is the persisted grace duration and defaults to `60`.

`lane.doctor` carries `authority`, `contract_version`, `product`, `ready`, and `native_path`.
The command exits non-zero when either service is unreachable even though its JSON report is still
complete.

## Accounting

Every `turn.completed` carries an `accounting` block with App Server duration, start, and completion
fields plus normalized token counters, and a `usage` block. `cost` is deliberately `null` with
`cost_available: false` — the bridge does not guess pricing. Do not compute or present a cost.

## Terminal notices

The unified daemon delivers a durable terminal pointer to the lane's immediate Sessionbus
parent automatically. `owner_session_id` identifies that parent attachment; there is no
`notify_target`, `--notify`, or `--no-notify` branch in this lifecycle surface.
The notice contains lane, thread, turn, status, outcome, exit, and the current
collection state. `collection=required` includes a structured
`sessionbus.lane` `wait` hint; `collection=none` means the turn was
already consumed. `lane.ready` reports the selected target, ownership, and persistence mode.
Terminal pointers, and ordinary peer messages sent by a parent-owned lane to its exact owner, use
that established parent relationship and do not trigger a prompting/bypass mismatch approval.
Messages from unrelated or persistent lanes retain their actual sender permission class.

The notice describes the App Server turn. It never carries the answer.
